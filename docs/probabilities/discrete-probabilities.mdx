# Discrete probabilities

## Requirements

:::caution
If you are new to probabilities, you may want to learn the basics. To do that, please read this [introductory course](elementary-probabilities).
:::

:::info
Before starting this course, you should read this two blog posts :

- [Why do we use Lebesgue integration for probabilities ?](../../blog/why-do-we-use-lebesgue-integration-for-probabilities)
- [Discrete probabilities versus continuous probabilities](../../blog/discrete-probabilities-vs-continuous-probabilities)

## Definitions

:::definition probability
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A})$ be a measurable or probabilisable space.
We call *probability* on $(\Omega, \mathcal{A})$ all application $\mathbb{P} : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that :

- $\mathbb{P}(\Omega) =  1$
- For all families $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of pairwise disjoint sets of $\mathcal{A}$, we have

$$
    \mathbb{P}(\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{P}(A_n)
$$

:::definition probability space
A triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ is called a probability space.

## Discrete random variables

:::definition random variables
Let $(F, \mathcal{B})$ be a measurable space.
We call **random variable** defined on $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ and having values in $F$,
any measurable application $X : \Omega \rightarrow F$, i.e. satisfaying for all $B \in \mathcal{B},
X^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{A}$ with

$$
    X^{-1}(B) = \{\omega \in \Omega \textnormal{ such that } X(\omega) \in B\}
$$

We say that $X$ is a **discrete random variable** if its surrounding area $X(\Omega)$ is finite or countably infinite.

More generally if there exists a discrete set (finite ou countably infinite) $B \in X(\Omega)$ such that
$\mathbb{P}(X \in B) = 1$ we also say that $X$ is a random variable. We then call the support of $X$
the smallest discrete set $\tilde{B}$ verifying $\mathbb{P}(X \in \tilde{B}) = 1$.
In practice, $X(\Omega)$ is still called the support of $X$, which is clearly an abuse of notation.

## Laws of discrete probabilities

:::definition and proposition : law of probability
Let $X$ be a random variable. We call law of probability of $X$ the probability measure $\mathbb{P}_X$
defined on $(F, \mathcal{B})$ on :

$$
\mathbb{P}_X(B) := \mathbb{P}(X^{-1}(B)) = \mathbb{P}(X \in B), \quad \forall B \in \mathcal{B}
$$

This is the image measure of $\mathbb{P}$ by $X$
:::

:::proof
First of all, $\mathbb{P}_X$ is well defined : if $B \in \mathcal{B}$, then $(X \in B) \in \mathcal{A}$,
i.e. this is a random event, because $X$ is measurable. In particular, $\mathbb{P}(X \in B)$ makes sens.
We also have $\mathbb{P}_X(B)$ = $\mathbb{P}(X \in B) \in [0, 1]$ and
$\mathbb{P}_X(F)$ = $\mathbb{P}(X \in F) = \mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$. Now let $(B_n)_{n \geq 1}$
be a family of
