# Likelihood

## Definition

:::definition
We assume that we observe the realisations $x_1, \dots, x_n$ of the random variables $X_1, \dots, X_n$. The function
$$
\theta \rightarrow \prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb P_\theta(X_i = x_i)
$$

is called the likelihood of \theta for the realisation $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ and is denoted $L(\theta; x_1, \dots, x_n )$
or simply $L(\theta)$ if there is no ambiguity.
