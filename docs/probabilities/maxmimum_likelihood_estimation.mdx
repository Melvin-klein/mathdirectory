# Maximum likelihood estimation

## Definition

:::definition
Suppose that for any observation $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ of the random variables $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ there exists a single value $\theta$, denoted $\hat\theta_n^{MV}$ such that the likelihood is maximised.

$$
L(\hat\theta_n^{MV})(x_1, \dots, x_n; x_1, \dots, x_n) = \max_\theta L(\theta; x_1, \dots, x_n)
$$

Then we say that $\hat{\theta}_n^{MV}(x_1, ..., x_n)$ is a maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$.

The corresponding random variable $\hat\theta_n^{MV}(X_1, ..., X_n)$, denoted $\hat\theta_n^{MV}$ or $\hat\theta^{MV}$ is
called the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$.
