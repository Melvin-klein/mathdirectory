# Vector spaces

A vector space is a mathematical structure that offers very interesting properties. The main element of a vector space is called a vector. We say that it is a structure because you can use operations between this vectors

:::tip Definition : Vector space

Let $E$ be a non empty set, with two operations : an internal operation (or law) called addition and noted $+$:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
  E \times E & \longrightarrow & E \\
  (u, v) & \longrightarrow & u + v
\end{array}
$$

and an external operation (or law) called *multiplication* and noted $\cdot$ :

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
  \mathbb{K} \times E & \longrightarrow & E \\
  (\lambda, u) & \longrightarrow & \lambda \cdot u
\end{array}
$$

We say that $(E, +, \cdot)$ is a vector space on $\mathbb{K}$ or a $\mathbb{K}$-vector space if the following properties are satisfied :

- The addition on $E$ is :
  1. commutative : $u + v = v + u$ for all $(u, v) \in \mathbb{K}^2$
  2. associative : $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$ for all $(u, v, w) \in \mathbb{K}^3$
