# Binomial coefficient

## Definition

:::definition
Let $n$ and $p$ be two natural integers, we call binomial coefficient, and we note $\binom{n}{p}$, the following number

$$
\binom{n}{p} = \frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}
$$
:::

:::remark
For all $n \in \mathbb N$, we have $\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1$
:::

## Results

:::proposition
For all $(n, p) \in \mathbb N^2$ such that $n \geq p \geq 1$, we have

$$
\binom{n}{p} = \frac{n}{p} \binom{n-1}{p-1} = \frac{n-p+1}{p}\binom{n}{p-1}
$$
:::

:::proof
It is straightforward from the definition by putting $p$ in the denominator and in the numerator the first or the last term.

:::proposition
Let $n$ and $p$ be two natural integers, we have

$$
\begin{align}
\binom{n}{p} = & \binom{n}{n-p} \quad \text{if} \quad p \leq n. \\
\binom{n}{p} = & \binom{n-1}{p} + \binom{n-1}{p-1} \quad \text{if} \quad p \geq 1
\end{align}
$$
:::

:::proof
By calculation, from the definition of $\binom{n}{p}$.
