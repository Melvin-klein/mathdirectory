# n-th roots

## Definition

:::definition
- If $z \in \mathbb C$, we call n-th root of $z$ any $Z \in \mathbb C$ such that $Z^n = z$.
- The n-th roots of one are also called root of unity.
:::

## Root of unity

:::proposition
It exists exactly $n$ root n-th of unity, which are the complexes

$$
    \xi_k = e^{i\frac{2k\pi}{n}} = \xi_1^k, \quad \text{avec } k \in [0, n-1] \subset \mathbb N.
$$
:::

:::proposition
Let $n$ be an integer greater than or equal to 2.

- if $\xi$ is a n-th root of unity not equal to 1, we have

$$
1 + \xi_1 + \xi_2 + \dots + \xi^{n-1} = 0.
$$

- The sum of n-th roots of unity is equal to 0.

## n-th root

:::proposition
If $Z_0$ si a n-th root of $z$, the set of n-th root of $z$ is

$$
\{ Z_0\xi; \xi \in \mathbb U_n \}.
$$
:::

:::proposition
Let $n \neq 0$ be an integer and let $z \neq 0$ be complex number of module $r$ and with argument $\theta$, the complex number
$z$ admits $n$ n-th roots which are the complex numbers :

$$
Z_k = r^{\frac{1}{n}}e^{i(\frac{\theta}{n} + \frac{2k\pi}{n})} \quad \text{ with } \quad k \in [0, n-1] \subset \mathbb N.
