# Supremum/Infimum

In this sheet, $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb R$.

## Definition

:::definition Supremum
The supremum is, if it exists, the lowest upper bound. It is noted as

$$
\operatorname{sup}(A)
$$
:::

:::definition Infimum
The infimum is, if it exists, the higher lower bound. It is noted as

$$
\operatorname{inf}(A)
$$
:::

## Results

:::proposition Property of the Supremum
If $A$ is not empty and is upper bounded then it admits a supremum.
:::

:::proposition Characterization of the Supremum
Let $a$ be a real number. The supremum of $A$ is $a$ if, and only if,

$$
\forall x \in A, x \leq a \qquad \text{and} \qquad \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists x \in A, a - \epsilon < x.
$$

The same ideas exist for the infimum.
