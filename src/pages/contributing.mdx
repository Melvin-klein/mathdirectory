# About contributing

## The Math Directory mission

Welcome to Math Directory, a valuable mathematical resource that serves as a dictionary for all mathematics enthusiasts. This platform is much more than just a dictionary; it aims to be a collaboration of mathematics enthusiasts from around the world, working together to create a comprehensive source of information accessible to all.

**Limitless exploration**: This site offers a variety of definitions, theorems, formulas, examples and explanations for a wide range of mathematical concepts. Whether you're looking for a clear explanation of a basic concept or are looking for complex details, our mathematical dictionary is your guide.

**Collaboration and continuous updating**: The beauty of this open-source platform lies in its collaborative nature. I want mathematicians, teachers and passionate amateurs from all over the world to contribute their knowledge and expertise. This means that the content will be constantly updated, improved and enriched to reflect advances in the field of mathematics.

**Accessibility**: I believe in the democratisation of mathematical knowledge. Our site is accessible free of charge, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to anyone with an Internet connection. There are no financial barriers to accessing knowledge.

**User-friendly browsing**: The site is designed for smooth, intuitive browsing. You can search for specific terms, explore particular areas of mathematics, follow related links and learn more with every click.

**A commitment to community**: Math Directory is more than just an online resource. It's a gathering place for maths enthusiasts. You can participate in discussions, ask questions, share tips and knowledge, and become part of a community of mathematicians.

We invite you to explore our open-source mathematical dictionary, contribute if you wish, and make this resource an indispensable source for your mathematical needs.Mathematics is a universal language, and we're proud to help make it more accessible and understandable to everyone.Join us on this exciting mathematical adventure!

## How to contribute ?

Taking part in an open source project in mathematics is an exciting opportunity to contribute to the advancement of this discipline while developing your skills and collaborating with other creative minds. Here's an overview of the different ways you can get involved in these projects:

- **Contributions to content**: One of the most obvious ways to get involved is to contribute to the mathematical content itself. You can add new definitions, theorems, proofs, examples, or correct existing errors. This direct contribution improves the quality and completeness of the resource.

- **Writing articles**: If you have a passion for writing, you can write mathematical articles. These articles can explain complex concepts in an accessible way, present application cases or share interesting stories related to mathematics. Your pen can make mathematics more attractive to a wider audience.

- **Translation**: If you are fluent in several languages, you can help translate existing mathematical content into other languages. This broadens the scope of the resource and makes it accessible to mathematical communities around the world.

- **Website development** : Math Directory requires web development to improve its website.

- **Promotion and awareness-raising**: Publicising the project, recruiting new contributors and raising awareness of the importance of mathematics can also be valuable contributions.

- **Financial support**: If you don't have the time to contribute directly to the project, you can support it financially by making donations to help cover web hosting costs.

In short, there is a place for everyone in open source mathematics projects, whatever your talents and level of expertise. Your contribution can make a real difference in promoting mathematics accessible to all and in creating a useful global resource for enthusiasts and learners. Join the open source mathematics community and be part of this exciting collaborative adventure.
